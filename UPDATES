EPIC4-2.2

*** News -- 10/25/2004 -- $stripcrap(ALL) no longer strips "ALL_OFF"...
        because the crap-mangler makes liberal use of ALL_OFFs and it is of
        no harm to leave them in there, and it does great harm to take them
        out. ;-)  If you want to remove them, do $stripcrap(ALL,ALL_OFF)
	This applies to the /SET MANGLE_* variables, as well the logfile
	mangle stuff -- anything that works with the markup codes.

*** News -- 10/06/2004 -- Support for +e and +I numerics from efnet
	EFNet has +e and +I channel modes, which act like +b does.
	These numerics are now handled by epic like +b is.

*** News -- 10/06/2004 -- New status bar expandos, %{2}W and %{3}W
	These two new expandos expand to the same value as %W.  

	%W    	Expands on each input window on each screen that has
		two or more visible windows.

	%{2}W	Expands on all visible windows on all screens.

	%{3}W	Expands on each input window on each screen, even on
		screens that have only one visible window.

*** News -- 10/06/2004 -- Support for ircnet's "numeric nick" feature
	On ircnet, each user is given a unique numeric identifier, which
	is their one true nickname.  In addition to this numeric id, they
	can have a rfc1459 nickname, but they are not required to have one.
	Further, the special numeric id 0 is reserved and refers to the
	user's own numeric id.  EPIC now fully supports all of this, 
	particularly in the following ways:

	/NICK <unique id>
	/NICK 0
		To turn off your rfc1459 nickname.

	$serverctl(GET <refnum> UNIQUE_ID)
	$serverctl(SET <refnum> UNIQUE_ID)
		To retrieve and change your unique nickname.  
		Changing your unique id is probably a bad idea.

	/USERHOST <unique id>
		You may USERHOST unique id's now.

	'epic 0'
		You may now use the nickname 0 on the epic command
		line if you don't want to use an rfc1459 nickname
		on an ircnet server.

	Using unique numeric id's on non-ircnet servers is probably 
	fraught with peril.  Try to avoid that.

*** News -- 10/06/2004 -- /SET INDENT maxes out at 1/3 screen width
	Previously, if you did /set indent on, and the width of the 
	first word on the first line was > 1/3 of the screen's width,
	then the second (and subsequent) lines were not indented at all.
	This was the historical ircII behavior.  It seems more sensible
	to cap the indent level at 1/3 of the screen's width and indent
	it to there.
