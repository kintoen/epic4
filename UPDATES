EPIC4-2.8

*** News 09/06/2007 -- New functions $strtol() and $tobase.
	$strtol(b s) converts string s to an integer, as if the string
	is a number of the base b. $strtol(16 f) will return 15.
	$tobase(b i) converts integer i to base b.
	Backported from EPIC5 for |Rain|.

*** News 07/04/2007 -- New $windowctl() option, $windowctl(GET refnum CHANNELS)
        You can now fetch all of the channels in a window by using
                $windowctl(GET <refnum> CHANNELS)
        There is no defined order to the channels returned.
	This was backported from EPIC5 by special request of BlackJac.
