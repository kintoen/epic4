EPIC4-2.8

*** News 07/04/2007 -- New $windowctl() option, $windowctl(GET refnum CHANNELS)
        You can now fetch all of the channels in a window by using
                $windowctl(GET <refnum> CHANNELS)
        There is no defined order to the channels returned.
	This was backported from EPIC5 by special request of BlackJac.
