THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* New version of /load hold_mode (implements /set hold_interval)
* Fix crash with $write(w<number> text)
* Fix the build on systems without intmax_t/strtoimax().
* Add /on signal (pegasus)
* Fix /set indent if /set continued_line contains ^C stuff (pegasus)
* Patch from larne to fix build on interix
* sig.inc should be created in the include directory. (rb larne)
* Fix build on systems where CFLAGS doesn't get set (larne)
* More changes for larne's cross-building project.
* Move "term.h" out of the way so we can #include <term.h> (mv'd to termx.h)
* This makes it possible to avoid empty decls for tparm()
* Which is supposed to fix the build for larne on who-only-knows-what.
* Rename tparm() to my_tparm().
* Do a make depend since i changed the name of a header file. ugh.
* Change the name of (struct term) to (struct my_term) for freebsd sake. ugh.
* Resolve build conflicts between x/open curses and ncurses. ugh.
