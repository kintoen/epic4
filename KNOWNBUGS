* Add /on error, hooks on an irc protocol ERROR message.
* Fix window.c:get_boolean(), passing unitialized 'newval' integer.
* Fix path_search() to not blithely assume path != NULL (whitedragon)
* New version of the 'hybrid6' script, from is.
* Axe the broken "input_timeout" feature that hasn't worked in 6 years.
* Add, but #ifdef'd out, a delayed-free mechanism -- strictly experimental.
* Add the /defer command, to perform dangerous operations when it's safe.
* Many changes from robohak to fix /on channel_* bogons I introduced. ;-)
* Lice should now work again with 0.9.16.
