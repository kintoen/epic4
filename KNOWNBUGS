[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* When the server terminates a connection, save channels for reconnect.
* Add "dont_save_server_channels" function.
* Remove some #ifdef 0'd out code in names.c.
* Always specify what we want to be done with channels before calling
	close_server() -- failure to do so results in a panic.
* Always save channels when an unexpected EOF occurs from the server.
* Fix the 010 numeric handler -- don't use ArgList after display_msg, duh!
* Fix the 464 numeric handler; that "odd" thing was bogus.
* Fix a typo in the 477 numeric handler.
* Fix p_privmsg to send public messages to LOG_PUBLIC and not LOG_MSG, duh!
* Fix passwd_sendline to get the server refnum from "data" and not "line", duh!
* Passworded servers now are handled correctly. Huzzah!
* FD_CLR filedesc's after FD_ISSET in input handlers, to avoid bogons.
* Fix /disconnect to call close_server() and update_status().
* Release epic4-0.10.0
