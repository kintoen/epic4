[See http://www.epicsol.org/PROJECTS for things to come in the future]
[See http://www.epicsol.org/CHANGELOG for things that changed in the past]

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Fix null deref when you do /window flush while not in hold mode.
* Fix /away -all
* Fix /window <refnum> scroll_[backwards|forwards]
* Fix 353 numeric so channels w/o users on ratbox aren't "odd"
* Fix problems with translation, particular for zlonix.
* A tab between [ref] and pattern in /ignore is visually jarring. Use space.
