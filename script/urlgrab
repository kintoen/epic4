# urlgrab - URL Grabber Script for EPIC
# Copyright 2004 Brian Hauber
# Originally written for WC's Toolbox (WCTB)
# Please use and distribute this script like crazy!
#
#
# Why this script:
# With mIRC dominating the IRC scene these days, people paste long URLs
# that those of us with a text-based IRC client can't just click on. Add
# to that EPIC's line breaks, cutting and pasting these URLs to your browser 
# can be a pain.
#
# What it does:
# Save a URL sent to a channel or sent via msg to a file as a hyperlink
# in your ~/public_html that you can then browse and click in a web browser
# of your choice.
#
# Usage:
#		/URLGRAB toggles the script on and off

# Change this file to whatever you want.
@ urlfile = [$HOME/public_html/urls.html]

# Create file if it doesn't exist
if (fexists($urlfile) == -1) {
	@ fd = open($urlfile W)
	@ close($fd)
}

# Make sure perms are correct so you can browse it
if (fexists($urlfile) == 1) {
	@ chmod($urlfile 644)
}

# Converts boolean numbers to words
alias onoff return ${([$0] == 1) ? [ON] : [OFF]}

# Turn URL grabber on/off
alias urlgrab {
	@ urlgrab = (urlgrab) ? 0 : 1
	xecho -b URL grabber is $onoff($urlgrab).
}

# Grabs URL out of message and writes it as a hypertext link to a file.
alias grabit {
	if (urlgrab) {
		@ :fd = open($urlfile W)
		@ :wordno = match("\\[http:% *www.%\\]" $1-)
		@ :wordno = wordno - 1
		@ :url = word($wordno $1-)
		if (!match(http% $url)) {
			@ :url = [http://] ## url
		}
		@ :datetime = strftime(%m-%d-%Y %H:%M)
		@ :link = [<a href="] ## url ## [">] ## url ## [</a><br>]
		@ write($fd [$datetime] &lt;$0\&gt; $link)
