# converted to 2.2.1 by phone
# CONVERTED for ircII2.2
# Version for servers 2.7.1* by Nap@irc <pioch@poly.polytechnique.fr>
# Original script from YeggMan
# Simplification by Daemon
# Super Simplification by hop
# works with only the new kill format.
# Now that we have on ^kill in EPIC4, this is ridiculously trivial.
